Homework #12 - Web Scraping Homework

Run app.py

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a web browser

Click on the button to scrape new Mars data

Please be patient, the scrape takes a few minutes to run

A number of browsers will open and close while the scrape is running - feel free to look at them but do not close any of them as the code will error out if you do that.

Enjoy!
